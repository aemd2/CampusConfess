# 🔌 Supabase MCP Connectivity Check - MANDATORY AT START

**⚠️ CRITICAL: This rule MUST be executed at the beginning of EVERY chat session.**

## 📋 What This Rule Does

At the start of every chat, you MUST verify that the Supabase MCP (Model Context Protocol) server is running and accessible.

## ✅ Step 1: Check Supabase MCP Connection (FIRST THING EVERY CHAT)

**At the very beginning of every new chat session, you MUST:**

1. **Attempt to list Supabase projects** using the MCP tool
2. **Verify the connection is working**
3. **If successful**: Proceed normally with the user's request
4. **If failed**: STOP immediately and inform the user

### How to Check:

```
Use: mcp_supabase_list_projects
```

## 🚨 If Supabase MCP Connection Fails

**IF the connection check fails, you MUST:**

1. **STOP all other operations immediately**
2. **Do NOT attempt to write code or make changes**
3. **Display error message to the user**

## ✅ If Connection Succeeds

If the Supabase MCP connection is successful:

1. ✅ **Silently note** that the connection is working
2. ✅ **Proceed** with the user's request
3. ✅ **You can now use all Supabase MCP tools** as needed

## 📚 Common Supabase MCP Commands

Once connection is verified, you can use these tools:

- `mcp_supabase_list_projects` - List all projects
- `mcp_supabase_list_tables` - View tables in database
- `mcp_supabase_execute_sql` - Run SQL queries
- `mcp_supabase_get_advisors` - Check security/performance
- `mcp_supabase_list_migrations` - View migration history
- `mcp_supabase_apply_migration` - Create new migrations

**This check is non-negotiable. Always verify MCP connectivity first.**
