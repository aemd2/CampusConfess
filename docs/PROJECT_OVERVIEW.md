# CampusConfess - Project Overview
**Simple 5-Minute Summary**

---

## What We're Building

**CampusConfess** is an anonymous confession app exclusively for college students. Think "YikYak meets Instagram confessions" - but safer, campus-specific, and monetized.

---

## The Problem

Students use Instagram confession pages which have problems:
- Run by random students (no oversight)
- No moderation (bullying, threats)
- Not campus-exclusive
- Get shut down (violate Instagram ToS)

## Our Solution

- **Campus-Only**: Verified .edu emails
- **Moderated**: AI + student moderators
- **Legal**: GDPR/CCPA compliant
- **Monetized**: Ads + premium features
